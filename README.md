# Project Postter

The project was developed to selective process, see below the steps to run project and time budget used.

### Time budget

1. Study, analysis and construction of the infrastructure strategy -> 6 hours
2. Develop to back-end in Laravel(php) -> 5 hours
3. Develop to back-end in Loopback(nodejs) -> 3,5 hours
4. Document to api -> 1,5 hours

### Prepare environment

To run project you just need install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). After install docker, you need to guarantee that the user docker has permission to execute the project.

#### Run project

Remember to check if the ports of services is available.

* 8080      -> back-end laravel
* 3000      -> back-end loopback
* 6379      -> cache redis
* 3306      -> database mysql
* 9200/9300 -> database elasticsearch
* 5601      -> view elasticsearch kibana
* 5672      -> queue rabbitmq
* 15672     -> manager rabbitmq

Open terminal/cmd in project root folder and execute:

`docker-compose up -d --build`

Check is all services is runing with command:

`docker ps`

Should return:

If not run all services run separate:

`docker-compose up -d {{service_name}}`

### Application Strategy

The laravel was used to manager every application, but at the same time it synchronizes the database mysql with elasticsearh. The justify is that a database Nosql has better performace in searchs/queries.

##### Laravel

Responsible by manager app, it run schedule/job to capture likes of posts e save in mysql database. The redis was used in much endpoints to relieve direct requests to the database.

Roadmap:

* Make tests
* Abstract service of posts by cache-redis
* Authenticate User to list posts, followins, followers, likes and all resources

##### Elasticseach

Database Nosql has better performace to queries.

##### Loopback

Synergy with elasticsearch and skilled to work with API/microservices.

Roadmap:

* Make tests
* Sync follows
* Configure follows relationship with resource of posts

##### Rabbitmq

Queue architecture, was used to synchronize events the laravel with loopback

### Back-End Laravel

1. Install libs composer:

`docker exec postter-laravel-api composer install`

`docker exec postter-laravel-api php artisan config:clear`

`docker exec postter-laravel-api php artisan key:generate`

`docker exec postter-laravel-api php artisan migrate`

`docker exec postter-laravel-api php artisan db:seed`

2. Run watch Jobs:

`docker exec postter-laravel-api php artisan schedule:work`

### Back-End Loopback

Access [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000),you can see /openapi.json and /explorer to document api.

Basically the intention is centralize the searchs of posts this service, becou
